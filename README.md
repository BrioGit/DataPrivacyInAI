# DataPrivacyInAI

This repository contains the slides and code from our meetup that went over the challenges of using cloud based AI solutions when it comes to protecting the privacy of your data.

The demonstration code can be found in the `src/` folder. Execute the Jupyter Notebook file ` CloudMeetup-PII-Detail-demo.ipynb`` to run/view the demo.  Before running the code, update  `config.json`` to include the enpoints and keys for your Azure Language Service and Azure OpenAI Service.
